# earthquake-recognition

<<<<<<< HEAD
I am researching using neural nets for earthquake detection.

Pretty messy right now, I'll clean up the Repo at the end of this internship.

(I accidentally deleted the repo's history, there should be a few hundred commits)



### Neural Nets for earthquake recognition

1. Retrieving and processing the data:

2. Training the Data with Neural Nets (where I'm at now, for the next month)

### Other Stuff

##### Basic Data Processing:

Pretty messy right now.

An interesting notebook to look at:
